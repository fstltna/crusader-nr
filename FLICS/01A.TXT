First, let me say welcome to the Resistance, Captain.
@frame 170  
I'm sure you realize that Central thinks you're a spy. 
@frame 230
but I've reviewed your tapes and I think I understand you.   
@frame 320
Enough so that I've persuaded Central to give you a chance.
@frame 380 
One shot, to prove your sudden change of heart.
@frame 440
You will lead an attack to take a Consortium refinery off-line,
@frame 500
Permanently!
@frame 530  
An informant will provide you with a security card
@frame 590 
that will allow you entrance into the facility.
@frame 650
Your main objective is the thermal coupler on level 4.  
@frame 710
Once you have placed the PAC, our extraction specialist 
@frame 770
will give you the coordinates of the nearest teleport pad.  
@frame 830
Consult your DataLink if you have any further questions.  
@frame 890
Good luck. Maxis, out.
